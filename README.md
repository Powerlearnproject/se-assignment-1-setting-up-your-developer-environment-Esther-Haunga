docker pull python:latest
This command downloads the latest Python image from the Docker Hub repository.

Step 5: Create Dockerfile (Optional)
If required, I created a Dockerfile to define the configuration of my Docker container, including installing additional packages, setting environment variables, and copying project files into the container.

Here's an example Dockerfile for a Python project:

Dockerfile
Copy code
FROM python:latest

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
Step 6: Build Docker Image
Using the Dockerfile, I built a Docker image for my development environment. I navigated to the directory containing the Dockerfile and ran the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t my-python-app .
This command builds a Docker image named "my-python-app" based on the instructions in the Dockerfile.

Step 7: Run Docker Container
Finally, I ran a Docker container based on the image I built. For example, to start a container for my Python app:

bash
Copy code
docker run -it --rm my-python-app
This command starts a Docker container interactively (-it flag) and removes it after it stops (--rm flag).

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration. Step 1: Open VS Code and Access Extensions
